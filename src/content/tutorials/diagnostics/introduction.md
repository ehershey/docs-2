# Particle Diagnostics

As you deploy your IoT fleet into the field, it becomes increasingly
important to ensure that devices stay in a healthy state. In addition,
when problems do arise, the ability to quickly identify and implement a
solution are paramount to the reliability of your production deployment.
This level of visibility can often be difficult to achieve without
physical access to these devices in the field.

Remote Diagnostics gives your team the power to actively monitor the health of
deployed units from the Console, without the need for custom development
or costly dispatching of technicians. Furthermore, in the event of a
device falling into an unhealthy state, your team will be empowered with
rich context and suggested courses of action to quickly diagnose and
rapidly resolve the issue.
